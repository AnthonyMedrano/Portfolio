# Portfolio

This portfolio contains two files regarding particle dynamics and retail data analysis. 

The files on particle dynamics reflect a sample of my research at USC. 
This is not a comprehensive nor polished set of files, but rather what I was able to find on short notice. 

The files on retail data analysis are simply a data science exercise.
